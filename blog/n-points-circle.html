<h1>N Points on a Circle</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Where geometry defines probability</div>

<p>
Place \(N\) points independently and uniformly on the circumference of a circle.
What is the probability that all points lie within a single semicircle?
</p>

<h2>Modeling the Problem</h2>

<p>
Fix one point and treat it as the start of a semicircle.
For all points to lie within that semicircle,
the remaining \(N-1\) points must fall within half the circle.
</p>

<h2>The Key Insight</h2>

<p>
Each point has an equal chance of being the leftmost boundary.
These events are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<h2>Result</h2>

<div class="math">
$$
P = N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{N-1}
$$
</div>
