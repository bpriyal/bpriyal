<h1>The Drunk Passenger</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Where recursion hides behind intuition</div>

<p>
One hundred passengers board a plane with exactly one hundred seats.
The first passenger is drunk and chooses a seat uniformly at random.
Every subsequent passenger takes their own seat if available; otherwise,
they choose randomly from the remaining seats.
</p>

<p>
What is the probability that the <em>last passenger</em> sits in their assigned seat?
</p>

<h2>Modeling the Problem</h2>

<p>
Despite the long boarding process, only two seats matter:
Seat 1 and Seat 100.
The uncertainty resolves the moment one of these seats is taken by a displaced passenger.
</p>

<h2>The Key Insight</h2>

<p>
Whenever a passenger must choose randomly, Seat 1 and Seat 100 are symmetric options.
No rule biases one over the other.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, one of them is chosen first.
</p>

<h2>Result</h2>

<div class="math">
$$
P(\text{last passenger sits correctly}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
</div>
