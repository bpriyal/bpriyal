<h1>The Coin Toss Game</h1>
<div class="subtitle">
Where symmetry simplifies complexity
</div>

<p>
Two players flip coins. Player A flips <em>n + 1</em> fair coins, while Player B flips <em>n</em>.
The winner is whoever gets more heads.  
At first glance, Player A seems advantaged — one extra coin should matter.
Surprisingly, it doesn’t.
</p>

<h2>Modeling the Problem</h2>

<p>
Instead of brute-forcing combinations, we decompose Player A’s coins into two parts:
the first <em>n</em> coins and the final extra coin.
We compare only the first <em>n</em> coins against Player B.
</p>

<p>
After those <em>n</em> tosses, there are only three possible states:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A is ahead</li>
  <li>B is ahead</li>
  <li>The game is tied</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because both players flipped identical numbers of fair coins, the “ahead” states
are symmetric.
</p>

<h2>The Key Insight</h2>

<p>
If Player A is already ahead, the extra coin doesn’t matter.
If Player A is behind, the extra coin can’t help.
Only when the game is tied does the extra coin decide the outcome.
</p>

<div class="math">
P(A wins) = P(ahead) + 0.5 · P(tie)
</div>

<p>
Symmetry forces these probabilities to collapse neatly:
</p>

<div class="math">
P(A wins) = 1/2
</div>

<p>
Despite flipping an extra coin, Player A has <strong>no advantage</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
This puzzle appears frequently in quantitative interviews because it tests
whether you search for structure before computation.
The correct solution avoids enumeration entirely.
</p>

<p>
If the coins were biased, the symmetry would break — and the result would change.
That extension is where simulation becomes useful.
